# 🎵 AI Music Generation

An AI-powered music generation project that uses deep learning techniques to create original melodies. This project leverages models such as LSTMs or Transformers trained on MIDI datasets to generate musical compositions.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎼 Generate original music in MIDI format
- 🎹 Train on classical, jazz, or custom genres
- 🧠 Supports LSTM and Transformer-based architectures
- 📈 Visualize generated music as piano rolls
- 💾 Export music as MIDI files for playback and editing

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.7+**
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch** – for training deep learning models
- **music21** – for parsing and analyzing MIDI files
- **pretty_midi** – for processing and exporting MIDI
- **matplotlib** – for visualizations

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-music-generator.git
   cd ai-music-generator
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download or prepare a MIDI dataset**
   - Use datasets like [MAESTRO](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/maestro) or [Lakh MIDI](https://colinraffel.com/projects/lmd/)
   - Place them in the `data/` folder

## 🧑‍💻 Usage

Train a model:
```bash
python train.py --model lstm --epochs 50
```

Generate music:
```bash
python generate.py --model lstm --output output/generated.mid
```

Visualize piano roll:
```bash
python visualize.py --file output/generated.mid
```

## 📸 Example Output

> *(Include sample piano roll images and audio snippets)*

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

- `--model`: Choose between `lstm` or `transformer`
- `--epochs`: Number of training epochs
- `--output`: Path to save the generated MIDI file

## 💡 Future Enhancements

- Support for audio (WAV/MP3) output
- Genre conditioning
- Web interface for real-time generation
- Collaboration with DAWs (e.g., FL Studio, Ableton)
